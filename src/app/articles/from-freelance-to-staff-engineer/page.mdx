<ArticleLayout article={article}>
  For the past few years I worked across agency and freelance engagements,
  usually joining teams to solve hard delivery problems quickly. In 2025 I
  moved into a Staff Engineer role at MabyDuck, and it has shifted how I think
  about impact.

  Freelance work taught me how to land fast in unfamiliar codebases, get clear
  on scope, and deliver under pressure. Staff engineering asks for that same
  execution speed, but over a longer horizon: better systems, stronger team
  habits, and clearer technical direction.

  ## What changed

  1. I optimize for compounding outcomes, not one-off wins.
  2. I spend more time unblocking other engineers and shaping architecture.
  3. I think more about team throughput than individual output.
  4. I am more deliberate about technical debt and operational risk.

  ## What stayed the same

  1. Clear communication is still the highest leverage skill.
  2. Good engineering is still about tradeoffs, not perfect code.
  3. Reliability and accessibility still have to be built in from day one.
  4. Shipping matters, but learning loops matter just as much.

  ## What I am focused on next

  Right now I am focused on helping MabyDuck scale engineering quality without
  slowing product momentum. That includes architecture decisions, better
  delivery standards, and creating space for engineers to do their best work.

  I am still open to selective advisory conversations through Developerfy, but
  my core focus is building long-term product capability with one team.
