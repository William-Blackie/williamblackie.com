<ArticleLayout article={article}>
If I compress my recent career into one clean line it sounds very tidy: Torchbox agency years, then contracting through Developerfy, then product work at Mabyduck.

Living it felt much less like a neat staircase and much more like learning the same lessons at different speeds.

The biggest change was not title. It was time horizon.

## Agency years: pace, ambiguity, and calm under shifting priorities

At Torchbox (2019 to 2024), I learned how to enter unfamiliar systems quickly, make progress under delivery pressure, and work across design, content, strategy and engineering without everyone melting down.

Agency work forces a few habits you either learn or suffer:

- find constraints quickly;
- communicate in plain English;
- scope for delivery, not for architecture theatre;
- leave the codebase better than you found it.

The underrated part is keeping people calm when priorities move every five minutes. That skill still pays rent every week.

## Contracting: value under uncertainty

Contracting sharpened a different muscle: creating value quickly in systems you didn’t design, with limited runway for perfect onboarding.

I found myself asking the same questions every time:

- what actually matters right now;
- what risk is acceptable;
- what change is reversible;
- what must be written down for whoever comes next.

That made me stricter about leaving intent in the code and in the docs. If future engineers cannot understand why I did a thing in one pass, I am not finished, even if the ticket says “done”.

Contracting also killed my appetite for “let’s explore for a few months”. Exploration is fine, but it still needs to end somewhere useful.

## Product work: compounding outcomes over months, not sprints

Moving into full-time product work changed the scoring model. You still need pace, but you now live with the long tail of your own decisions.

The questions I ask now are a bit more boring, and therefore more useful:

- does this reduce repeated incidents in the next quarter;
- does this make delivery easier for the whole team, not just this feature;
- can we reverse course safely if assumptions change;
- are we improving reliability and speed together.

Earlier in my career I measured progress mostly by direct output. I still like shipping a lot, but I care more now about whether the team ships predictably without heroics.

## What stayed the same across every chapter

The context changed. The core rules didn’t:

- clarity beats cleverness;
- accessible, reliable software is non‑negotiable;
- good scope is ambitious and controlled, not maximal;
- most engineering pain is communication pain wearing a technical disguise.

Those principles worked in agency projects, in contracts, and in product teams. They still do.

## Why I’m enjoying product work more right now

Product engineering has given me room to fix root causes instead of repeatedly treating symptoms. That is deeply satisfying if you care about long‑term delivery quality.

It also means fewer weekly fire drills, which weirdly gives me more energy for side projects and tinkering. Turns out calm systems are good for uptime and for humans.

## If you’re making a similar move

Don’t discard earlier strengths just because the context changed. Keep the pace from agency. Keep the decisiveness from contracting. Add durability from product ownership.

That blend has been the most useful version of engineering for me so far.

## Final thought

Career transitions are often framed as reinventions. Mine felt more like lens changes.

Same core values, same enjoyment of building useful things, better understanding of where speed helps and where speed becomes expensive.

And yes, I still enjoy a properly gnarly debugging session, provided it wraps before Friday dinner plans.
