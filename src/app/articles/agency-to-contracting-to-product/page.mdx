If you compress my recent career path into a single line, it looks very neat:

Torchbox agency years, then independent contracting via Developerfy, then product work at Mabyduck.

Living through it felt much less like a neat staircase and much more like learning the same lessons at different speeds.

The biggest change was not title. It was time horizon.

## Agency years: pace, ambiguity, and communication discipline

At Torchbox (2019 to 2024), I learned how to enter unfamiliar systems quickly, make progress under delivery pressure, and collaborate across design, content, strategy, and engineering without everyone melting down.

Agency work forces a few useful habits:

1. find constraints quickly;
2. communicate decisions in plain English;
3. scope for delivery, not for architectural theatre;
4. leave projects in a better state than you found them.

The most underrated skill from that period was communication under moving priorities. Agency timelines do not wait for perfect certainty. You learn to keep teams aligned while the ground shifts a bit every week.

That training still shapes how I work today.

## Contracting: value under uncertainty

I started Developerfy in March 2024 and moved into freelance/contract delivery, including a Google contract later that year.

Contracting sharpened a different muscle: creating value quickly in systems you did not design, with limited runway for long onboarding cycles.

You need to reduce ambiguity fast:

- what matters now;
- what risk is acceptable;
- what change is reversible;
- what must be documented for handover.

I became much stricter about keeping changes explicit and recoverable. If future engineers cannot understand intent in one pass, the work is not done, even if the ticket is "complete".

Contracting also improved decision sharpness. You cannot afford months of "we’re still exploring" energy. You need pragmatic direction with incomplete information, plus honest trade-off communication.

## Product work: compounding outcomes over months, not sprints

Moving into full-time product engineering at Mabyduck in 2025 changed the scoring model.

You still need pace. But you now live with the long tail of your own decisions. That changes what "good" looks like.

The questions I ask now are different:

1. does this decision reduce repeated incidents over the next quarter;
2. does this make delivery easier for the whole team, not just this feature;
3. can we reverse course safely if assumptions change;
4. are we improving reliability and speed together.

Earlier in my career, I measured progress mostly by direct output. I still love shipping, but now I care more about whether the team ships predictably without heroics.

That has been the most valuable shift for me.

## What stayed the same across every chapter

Despite the context changes, a few principles never changed:

1. Clarity beats cleverness.
2. Accessible, reliable software is non-negotiable.
3. Good scope is ambitious and controlled, not maximal.
4. Most engineering pain is communication pain in technical clothing.

Those principles worked in agency projects, in contracts, and in product ownership.

## Why I’m enjoying product work more right now

Product engineering has given me room to fix root causes instead of repeatedly treating symptoms. That is deeply satisfying if you care about long-term delivery quality.

It also left me with more energy for side projects because less weekly energy gets burned on avoidable operational noise.

Turns out calm systems are not just good for uptime; they are good for human energy as well.

## Advice I’d give engineers making a similar move

If you move from agency to contracting to product (or any variation), don’t discard earlier strengths just because the context changed.

Keep:

1. agency pace and collaboration discipline;
2. contracting decisiveness and pragmatic scoping;
3. product durability mindset and compounding quality focus.

That blend has been the strongest version of engineering for me so far.

## Final thought

Career transitions are often framed as reinventions.

Mine felt more like lens changes.

Same core values, same enjoyment of building useful things, better understanding of where speed helps and where speed becomes expensive.

And yes, I still enjoy a properly gnarly debugging session, provided it wraps before Friday dinner plans.
